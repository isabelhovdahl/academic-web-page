abstract: Recent research has found anthropogenic forcing to also affect
  day-to-day variability of temperatures. For many people, the climate is not
  only becoming hotter but also more volatile. Based on the new climate-economy
  literature, I explore the historical impact of day-to-day temperature
  variation on mortality in the United States over a 35-year period. I find that
  an extra +1°C of daily temperature variability caused an additional 0.206
  deaths per 100  000, equal to a 0.28% increase in the average monthly
  mortality rate. There is, however, evidence of adaptation to daily temperature
  variability as income and access to air-conditioning have increased and as
  people have become accustomed to large seasonal variation in temperatures.
  Given the deadly effect of day-to-day temperature variation, falling average
  daily temperature variability in the US since 1970 could have resulted in as
  many as 1400 and 1600 premature deaths avoided every winter and summer,
  respectively. In comparison, the increase in the number of days with a mean
  temperature above 35 ∘C could have caused an additional 655 premature deaths
  every year. These back-of-the-envelope calculations show that current
  estimates of the social cost of carbon are omitting an important channel for
  the mortality impact of climate change by not considering this additional
  effect of temperature volatility.
