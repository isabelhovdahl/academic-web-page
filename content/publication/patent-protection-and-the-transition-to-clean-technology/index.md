abstract: "It has proven to be a challenging task for policymakers to implement
  sufficiently high carbon taxes and public funding of research to induce the
  transition to clean technology. This calls for the exploration of alternative
  policy tools. In this context, this paper analyzes the use of patent
  protection as a new policy tool to help induce the transition to clean
  technology. It has been argued that patent protection works as a barrier to
  the diffusion of clean technology, and that clean technology should therefore
  be exempt from patent protection. This argument, however, does not consider
  the role of patent protection in incentivizing innovation. We therefore
  propose that to induce more clean innovation, it is *dirty* technology that
  should be exempt from patent protection. We explore this novel idea in a in a
  general equilibrium model with directed technical change, and where
  traditional environmental policy is constrained. We find that removing patent
  protection on dirty technology can in fact help foster the transition to clean
  technology, despite the increase in demand for dirty technology in the
  short-run. In addition, we find potentially large welfare gains from using
  patent protection as a policy tool when traditional environmental policy is
  constrained. "
