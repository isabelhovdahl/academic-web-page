abstract: "In Europe, producers of renewable energy are issued Guarantees of Origin (GOs) that they can sell to consumers who wish to declare their electricity consumption as “green”.  Although a third of European electricity consumption is currently backed by GOs, this market has received little attention in the literature. We contribute by exploring the effects of introducing a market for energy attributes on the market for the energy itself in a model of price competition. We find that introducing a downstream GO market can have a positive effect on competition in the spot electricity market, thus reducing electricity prices. In contrast, this pro-competitive effect disappears if the current market design is modified so that the trade of GOs is restricted by the transmission capacities in the spot market. Instead, the pro-competitive effect can be strengthened by policies that either increase demand or reduce the amount of electricity that qualifies for GOs."
